I am an assitant professor in the department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa. Previously, I was a Faragher distinguished postdoctoral fellow at IRSA in University of Minnesota. My research lies in theory and computational practice of high-dimensional statistics, Bayesian inference and optimization, with applications in machine learning, data science and game theory. I am currently working on topics including: inverse problems, MCMC, change-point detection and diffusion models.

I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at Nanjing University in 2016, my M.S. in Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison and my Ph.D. in Statistics, advised by  [Yves Atchad√©](https://math.bu.edu/people/atchade/index.html), at Boston University.
